#Exercise 1: Separating Your Fruits
#Given the list fruit_list, write a script that iterates through the list and prints each item
#on a separate line:


fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry", "kumquat", "orange",
"pineapple"]
# your code here


for ctr in fruit_list:
    print(ctr)



#Activity 2
#Write a Python script that asks the user for a string and displays the characters of the string to the user, with each character on a new line.

#For example, if the input is Hello, the output should be:

message = input("Eneter a message: ")
 
for ctr in message: 
    print(ctr)

#Activity 3
#Write a Python script that computes the length of a string without using the len() function.

message = input("Eneter a message: ")
count = 0 
for ctr in message:
    count += 1
print("the lenthg of the message is", count)





#Activity 4
#Create a program that takes an input list of strings, identifies all the strings with two or
#more characters, and stores the results in another list. For example, the following list
#a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
#would produce the following output:
#["bc", "rye", "hello"]


#a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]



mylist = []
a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
for ctr in a:
    if (len(ctr) > 2):
        mylist.append(ctr)
print(mylist)      



#Activity 5
#Write two scripts, each of which displays all numbers divisible by 50 between 100 and 1000 (inclusive).

#Use the range function with for in one script.
#Use while without range in the other script.
#Both scripts should have identical outputs.


for i in range(100,1001): 
     if i % 50 == 0: 
        print(i)

# script 2: while

i = 100
while (i<=1000):
    if i % 50 == 0: 
        print(i)
    i += 1


#Activity 6
#Create a script that computes the sum of all numbers between 0 and 100.

sum = 0

for i in range(0,101): 
    sum += i

print(sum)



#Activity 7
#Create a script that computes the factorial of any given number.

    print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)



#Activity 8

#Starting with the defined fruit_list in the following code block, update the script to perform
#the following tasks:
#•• Prompt the user to enter the name of a fruit.
#•• If the fruit is in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to tell the user its
#index value in the list.
#•• If the fruit is not in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to the user and
#prompt them to try again.
#•• The script should repeat itself until the user enters a stop word at the prompt.

#"pineapple"]

#Create a script that asks the user for a variable number of values and displays the sum of those values to the user.
