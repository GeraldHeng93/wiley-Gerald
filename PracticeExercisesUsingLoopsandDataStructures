#Activity 6
#Create a computer program that completes the following tasks:

#It prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
#The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
#After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry or enter another number.
#When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
#the product of the integers
#the average of the integers
#the sum of the integers
#the min of the integers
#the max of the integers
#After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
#the values the user entered
#each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value

#Do not use the built-in sum, min, or max functions.

#Activity 7
#Create a program that takes an input list of strings, identifies all the strings with two or
#more characters, and stores the results in another list. For example, the following list
#a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
#would produce the following output:
#["bc", "rye", "hello"]


#a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]



mylist = []
a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
for ctr in a:
    if (len(ctr) >= 2):
        mylist.append(ctr)
print(mylist)      





#Activity 8
#Write a computer program using the steps below:

#Create a dictionary with at least three key/value pairs.
#Ask the user for a value.
#Display all key/value pairs in the dictionary that include the user-specified value.
#If the value does not exist in the dictionary, display a user-friendly error message.
#For example:

#dictionary: freq_count = {"hello":4,"world":4,"I":1,"am": 2,"Martha:"3"}
#user input: 4
#output: {"hello":4,"world":4}



freq_count = {"hello":4,"world":4,"I":1,"am": 2,"Martha": 3}
usr=int(input("Please input an integer: "))
c=0
for i,j in freq_count.items():
              if j==usr:
                print("{",i,":",j,"}")
                c+=1
if c==0:
    print("no such value")
