#Activity 1

#Create a computer program that performs the following steps:

#Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.
#Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
#Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.
#Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")


num = input("Please enter a number: ")
print("You entered the type", type(num).__name__)
newNum = int(num)
print("The value is ", num ,"with type", type(newNum).__name__)

#Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?   => Error 
#Refactor the program, using a float instead of an integer. What happens if you enter an integer rather than a float at the prompt? => Str and then float


num = input("Please enter a number: ")
print("You entered the type", type(num).__name__)
newNum = float(num)
print("The value is ", num ,"with type", type(newNum).__name__)


#Activity 2
#Update the code below so that the result is equal to 576. 
#Do not change any of the existing values or operators or the order 
#in which they appear.


# do not change the order in which the numbers and operators appear in the next line
result = (5 + 3) ** 2 * 9 




#Activity 3
#Create a computer program that prompts the user for a float number and 
#returns the integer portion of the floating number.

import math     

val = float(input("Enter a floating number: "))
print("converted  to integer :",math.floor(val))


#Activity 4

#Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a 
#deposit for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is 
#calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.

#The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following 
#formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:

#V -- value
#P -- initial deposit
#r -- interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05)
#n -- the number of times per year interest is calculated
#t -- the number of years since the initial deposit
#V = P(1 + r/n)^nt

P = float(input("Enter initial deposite: "))
r = float(input("interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05): "))
n = int(input("the number of times per year interest is calculated: "))
t = int(input("the number of years since the initial deposit: "))

V=((1+ r/n)**(float(n)*float(t)))*P

print("total value after interest from the keyed in data is", round(V,2))


#activity 5
#Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount, the rate 
#of interest, and the number of days for a loan and then calculates and returns 
#the simple interest for the life of the loan. Use the formula:

p=float(input("Enter principle: "))
rate = float(input("interest rate (eg 5% (key in only the number)): "))
days = int(input("the number of days for interest calculation: "))


interest=p*rate*0.01*(days/365)

print("the simple interest gain is",round(interest,2))


#activity 6

#Create a computer program that displays three 
#statements that evaluate to True and three statements that evaluate to False.

#TRUE 1
a = 2
b = 3



print( "Statement 1", "a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is lesser than b its ", a<b  )

#TRUE 2

a = 2
b = 3



print("Statement 2","a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is lesser than b its ", a<b  )


#TRUE 3 

a = 3
b = 2



print( "Statement 3","a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is bigger than b its ", a>b  )


#false 1

a = 2
b = 2



print( "Statement 4","a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is not equal to b its ", a != b  )

#false 2 

a = 3
b = 2



print( "Statement 5","a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is smaller to b its ", a < b  )


#false 3

a = 2
b = 3



print( "Statement 6","a is", a, " b is",  b, " a is bigger to b its ", a > b  )



#activity 7

#Create a computer program that prompts the user for a number and calculates the following:

#the boolean of the number entered
#the binary equivalent of the number entered
#the square root of the number entered
#The program should display the following to the user:

#The number the user entered, in a phrase like, "You selected value."
#The boolean of the number, in a phrase like, "The boolean of your number is value."
#The binary equivalent of the number, in a phrase like, "The binary equivalent of your number is value"
#The square root of the number, in a phrase like, "The square root of your number is value," with the value rounded to three decimal places.

val = int(input("Eneter a integer "))
print("You selected ",val)
print("The boolean of your number is ",bool(val))
print("The binary equivalent of your number is ",bin(val))
print("The square root of your number is",round(val**0.5,3))


#activity 8


#Create a computer program that completes the following tasks:

#It prompts the user for a series of 5 integers.
#The user must be prompted for 5 numbers.
#After the fifth entry, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
#the product of the integers
#the average of the integers
#the sum of the integers
#After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
#the values the user entered
#each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value



import math

val=[int(input("Input an integer ")) for i in range(5)]

product=math.prod(val)

totalval=sum(val)

avg=sum(val) / len(val)

print("You entered the values", *val)
print("The product of the numbers is", product)
print("The average of the numbers is", round(avg,2))
print("The sum of the numbers is", totalval)





#acitivtiy 9

#Write a program that performs the following steps:

#Start with a street address that includes a building/house number, the name of the street, and the type of street (e.g., Street, Avenue, Boulevard, etc.).
#You can use any address you wish and abbreviations are acceptable.
#An example is 25 Main Street.
#Display the full address to the user.
#Display the house number only in a phrase like, "The building or house number is 25."
#Display the street name in a phrase like, "The street name is Main Street."


add="119 Gerald's Street"

print("The full address is ", add)
print("The house number is ", add.split()[0])
print("The full address is ", add.split()[1], add.split()[2])
