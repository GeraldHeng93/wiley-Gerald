#Acitivity 1
#Write a program that asks the user how much money they have 
#in their wallet. The program should output "You're rich!" if the user inputs $20 or more and "You're broke!" if the input is less than $20.



wallet =float(input("Enter how much money you have in your wallet: "))
if wallet>=20:
  print("You're rich!")
else:
  print("You're broke!")



#Acitivity 2

#Write a program that performs the following steps:

#Ask the user if they own any cats. (Yes/No answer)
#Ask the user if they own any dogs. (Yes/No answer)
#If the user responses indicate that they have both cats and dogs, output "You must really love pets!"
#Otherwise, the output should be "Maybe you need more pets."
#The last step will apply if the user has cats but not dogs, dogs but not cats, or neither cats nor dogs.

#Write two different versions of this program, one that uses only if statements and another that uses if-else statements.

#if ONLY 

cat=(input("Do you own any cats?(Y/N)")).upper()
dog=(input("Do you own any dogs?(Y/N)")).upper()

if cat=="Y" and dog=="Y":
  print("You must really love pets!")
if cat=="N" or dog=="N":
  print("Maybe you need more pets.")


#IF/ELSE

cat=(input("Do you own any cats?(Y/N)")).upper()
dog=(input("Do you own any dogs?(Y/N)")).upper()

if cat=="Y" and  dog=="Y":
    print("You must really love pets!")
else:
      print("Maybe you need more pets.")


#Acitivity 3
#Create a computer program that asks the user a few questions to which the user will respond either True or False. 
#Display all the questions with the correct answer and the user's answers at the end of the program, along with the user's the 
#correct response rate (number of questions answered correctly/number of questions).

#Activity 6
#Write a program that uses elif to produce five different possible outcomes based on a single user input.

#Ask the user what season it is (fall, winter, spring, or summer).
#If the user enters fall, output "I bet the leaves are pretty there!"
#If the user enters winter, output "I hope you're ready for snow!"
#If the user enters spring, output "I can smell the flowers!"
#If the user enters summer, output "Make sure your AC is working!"
#If the user enters a value that does not correspond to a season, output "I don't recognize that season."
#The user should be able to enter the name of the season in any case and the program will still work.

#Challenge: After you have the program working as describe above, modify the program so that the user can enter either "fall" or "autumn" and get the same result.
