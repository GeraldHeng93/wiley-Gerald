#Activity 1
#Create a program that sums all the values in a dictionary and displays them.


dictionary = {"hello":4,"world":4,"I":1,"am":2,"Martha":3}

for i in dictionary:

#Activity 2
#Write a program that displays the maximum and minimum values in a dictionary. You may use the same dictionary you used in the previous activity or create a new one.




dictionary = {"hello":4,"world":4,"I":1,"am":2,"Martha":3}


print("The maximum value is ", max(dictionary.values()))

#Activity 3
#Write a program that returns the sum of the integer elements in a set.

mySet = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

print("The sum of the set is ", sum(mySet))



#Activity 4
#Write a program that computes and displays the maximum and the minimum values in a set.

mySet = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

print("The maximum value is ", max(mySet))

#Activity 5
#Given the following dictionary storage, complete the following tasks:

#Add a key named "freezer".
#Set the value of "freezer" to be a list containing the items "ice cubes", "ice cream", and "pepperoni pizza".
#Sort the items in the cupboard using sort.
#Add "cream" to the fridge.
#Remove "sugar" from the cupboard.
#Subtract $25 from the emergency jar.

#Activity 6
#Create a new dictionary named shopping_list and add the following items to the dictionary:
#Loop through each item in the list and print out each key with its price. Print the answer in this format:
#Next, calculate how much it will cost if you purchase all the items on the list.
#Use a variable named total_cost to store the calculated value.
#Loop through the dictionary and add the price of each item to the total cost.
#After looping through the dictionary, print out the total cost in a message that is meaningful to the user.

#Activity 7
#Create two dictionaries: price and quantity.
#The price dictionary should be the same as the shopping_list dictionary in the previous activity:
#The quantity dictionary should have the same keys, but with values that represent the number of items to purchase rather than the price:
