SEV 4 - A minor issue with no impact on the customers' ability to use the service

Incident management process
-Identify key roles and clear chain of command

-Define responsibilities

-Communicate

Establish measurable objectives for the response
Issue assignments in a specific and timeboxed manner

Accountability

• Clearly identify yourself and your role
• Response operations need to be coordinated as directed by the
Incident Commander.
• Personal accountability for actions
• Track changes to the normal operations of the business
• Span of Control monitored to adequately supervise areas

Scribe: assist IC, captures communication, actions and discussions from conference bridge.
        capture all information for future use.

  Responsible for overall coordination
• Keeps incident moving towards resolution

Operations lead: work with IC to develop and solve the incident , recommend changes and solution  to IC, 
Coordinate operational team to restore service. Ask SME for help if needed 

Communications lead: responsible for internal & external comm. 
updates to status page and other media, maintain incident documentation

Planning lead: supports OL & IC, capture long-term issues, create tickets, arranging handoffs,tracking system divergence from SLO,

Compoents will be updated 

Alert fatigue
-on-call rotation
-alert fatigue (will lead to ignore alerts due to too many)
-burnout 

Continuous improvement 
-automation
-docuemntation
-reducing toil
